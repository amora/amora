#A hacker way to fix Ubuntu hardy for Amora

= Introduction =

Ubuntu hardy has a faulty bluez package for months, its a well known [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bluez-utils/+bug/227429 issue] which fix was not released yet for Hardy (but for Intrepid yes).

This makes several bluetooth client apps break, and so Amora too.

There is a way to workaround it, by installing Intrepid files. But be *warned* that it can bring problems for you system (mainly when upgrading, I guess).


= Details =

Download the [http://amora.googlecode.com/files/hardy_blue_bug.tar.bz2 packages] and extract it in a directory.

Install then in this order:

 * lsb-base: its a dependency

 * bluez-utils: has the fix

 * libbluetooth: updated bluetooth package

 * libbluetooth-dev: has the development packages

A faster way is to execute this script:

{{{
mkdir temp
cd temp
wget http://amora.googlecode.com/files/hardy_blue_bug.tar.bz2
tar -jxvf hardy_blue_bug.tar.bz2
sudo dpkg -i  lsb-base_3.2-14ubuntu1_all.deb bluez-utils_3.36-1ubuntu1_i386.deb libbluetooth2_3.36-1_i386.deb libbluetooth-dev_3.36-1_i386.deb 
}}}

After installing it, restart the computer. Amora server should be capable of work fine and cellphones will connect to your computer.

I'm no responsible for any damage in you computer and this is a hard hack, so be warned.

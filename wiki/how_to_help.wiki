So, you came to known Amora and think you could help in development? Good news, helping is easy!

There are several different ways to help us to make amora even better.


== Programmers ==

If you are a programmer and wish to code, please, take a look on the issues pages. There you can find soon to be added features as also bugs (remarkable few, by the way...) in the software.

The good news: the base code is small, anyone can understand easily how the soft works.

If you are able to code in Java (good!), Python or C (even better!), feel free to contact us and start to submit patches.

You still can write documentation, do software testing of new Amora releases, contribute with ideas, translate Amora help files to your native language, etc.

''Amora: a mobile remote assistant'''

= Project history and design =

Here there are some slides with some information about this project development history and software design. [http://amora.googlecode.com/files/amora15.pdf link]

= Rationale =
Most of notebooks are bluetooth ready, and case negative, a bluetooth dongle
is really cheap, as also cellphones with bluetooth are common place for
geek users.

Even if there are already MS-Windows only applications with similar
purpose, Unix users are forgotten. And strangely, the opensource projects
are cryptic to use (or not strangely after all...) or plain and simple
don't work.

I decided to write this code to answer my own need of an application that has:

  * Nice GUI on cellphone
  * Server side doesn't require any configuration

Also, expanding the idea of a simple remote control, Amora version 1.0 has some features that can be potentially useful for slide presentations:

  * a stopwatch
  * active window screenshot
  * Server support for multiple clients

== Hardware required ==
A Nokia cellphone S60 (3rd and 2rd editions are tested), Linux
(tested on Ubuntu 6.06, 6.10, 7.02, 7.10 i386 and x86-64, Debian) and a bluetooth dongle.


= Project status =
What works: mouse moving, clicking, mouse drag, mouse scroll wheel,
keyboard shortcuts (ENTER, ESC, SPACE, F5, 'F', left and right arrow keys). Bellow you can see the key layout for commands:

You can ask for screenshots of active window as also use a mode where for each mouse click the screenshot of active window is taken (very handy when driving slides).

Cellphone client can be started independently of server side application.
You can close the connection from cellphone and later reconnect without
restarting the server.

The server can detect when the client just died (e.g. cellphone turned off) as also the client can detect when the server is down.

Not only that, but the server in Amora version 1.0 supports multiple cellphones at *same* time (tested with 3 distinct devices) for collaborative presentations.

Its stable and I already use it to control my slides and movie watching (i.e.:
I can start a slide presentation, stop it, move the mouse cursor to a
directory, double click in a video file and control most of actions in
MPlayer).

== What is next ==

Development is on going, for new planned features check project tickets page ('Issues') and project description (in repository trunk).

Packaging of amora-server for Debian
------------------------------------

Packaging of amora-server and Amora itself reside in the same
subversion repository but since the Debian package is not the primary
target (the rpm packaging also resides in the same repository) and
changes in the Debian packaging will not result in a new Amora
release, it is package as non-native package.

The package is built out of the tarball you get with "make dist".

To build the package from a repository checkout of amora-server, make
sure the packages automake and autoconf (former build-deps) are
installed and then do the following:

$ make dist
$ mv amora-server-1.2.tar.gz ../amora-server_1.2.orig.tar.gz
$ cd ..
$ tar xvzf amora-server_1.2.orig.tar.gz
$ cd amora-server-1.2
$ cp -pr ../../amora-server/debian .
$ rm -rf debian/.svn
$ dpkg-buildpackage

Amora Systray Applet is a systray applet (duh) written in QT4 that runs the
server part of Amora, a program which allows a mobile phone to be used as a
kind of remote controller via bluetooth.

For more information about amora, visit the project website at

Project status:

   The current design is quite simple. As it requires libamora features
   which are not implemented yet, it just starts the amora-server code and
   does nothing with it. :P

   There are some stubs for features like notification and interaction with
   the user, but everything depends on the library.

   I like to follow the "release early, release often" rule, so the code is
   already public for other developers who may be interested. There's a lot
   of work to be done to "make it right" before a release is made for users:

   TODO:
     - do something more useful than just starting the server, such as event
       handlings:
        - new device connection (show a message)
        - device disconnection (show a message)
        - dongle removal (change the icon)
        - dongle connection (change the icon)
     - a proper build-system (cmake based is preferred)
     - a better (more beautiful) about screen

How to build it:

  You need qt4 (I used qt4.4), libamora and all its dependencies
  installed.

  Just run 'qmake-qt4' and then 'make'.

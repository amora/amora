Amora-applet is a systray applet (duh) written in Qt4 that runs the
server part of Amora, a program which allows a mobile phone to be used as a
kind of remote controller via bluetooth.

For more information about amora, visit the project website at
http://amora.googlecode.com/


Project status:

   The current implementation is simple yet fully functional: it implements
   all features exported by libamora, that is, it allows new connections and
   reports the server status (notifications of connections/disconnections).

   Future work should be done on libamora to be more flexible and provide
   detailed information to client applications.


How to build it:

  You need qt4 (tested with qt4.6), libamora and all its dependencies
  installed.

  Just run 'qmake' (or 'qmake-qt4' depending on your linux distribution)
  and then 'make'.
